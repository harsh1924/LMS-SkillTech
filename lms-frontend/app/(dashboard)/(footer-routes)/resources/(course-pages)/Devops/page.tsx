                            DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.

                            Automation is an important part of DevOps. Software programmers and architects should use "fitness functions" to keep their software in check.

                            Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term "DevOps".Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback. From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhuâ€”three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute-suggested defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality".However, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a combination of specific practices, culture change, and tools.
